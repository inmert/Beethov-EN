## Project Abstract
This is a Dall-E inspired music generation engine that will be able to compose musical compositions based on user inputs. Music generation using deep learning techniques has been a topic of interest for the past two decades. Music proves to be a different challenge compared to images, among three main dimensions: Firstly, music is temporal, with a hierarchical structure with dependencies across time. Secondly, music consists of multiple instruments that are interdependent and unfold across time. Thirdly, music is grouped into chords, arpeggios and melodies â€” hence each time-step may have multiple outputs.
